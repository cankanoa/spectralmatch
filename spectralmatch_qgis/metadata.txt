description=relative radiometric normalization toolkit for raster mosaics and time series
version=1.0.2
author=Kanoa Lindiwe LLC
email=cankanoa@gmail.com

about=Spectralmatch provides algorithms to perform relative radiometric normalization (RRN) to enhance spectral consistency across raster mosaics and time series. It is built for geoscientific use, with a sensor- and unit-agnostic design, optimized for automation and efficiency on arbitrarily many images and bands, and works well with Very High Resolution Imagery (VHRI) as it does not require pixel co-registration. Its current matching algorithms are inspired by @Yu:2017, which include global regression and local block adjustment that minimize inter-image variability without relying on ancillary data. The software supports cloud and vegetation masking, pseudo invariant feature (PIF) based exclusion, seamline network generation, raster merging, and plotting statistics. The toolkit is available as an open-source Python library, command line interface, and QGIS plugin. Explore this toolkitâ€™s features at https://spectralmatch.github.io/spectralmatch/. To install in QGIS, the spectralmatch Python library is required, for installation instructions, see https://spectralmatch.github.io/spectralmatch/installation/.
