# Dimensions of Relative Radiometric Normalization (RRN) Methods

RRN methods differ not only in the algorithms used to adjust image values but also in the requirements images must have and other techniques that can be used in conjunction. The following taxonomy summarizes the core dimensions along which RRN techniques vary:

 - **Matching algorithm:** The core transformation applied to align radiometry between images.
 - **Geometric alignment required:** The level of spatial alignment necessary for the method.
 - **Pixel selection (PIFs/RCS):** How pseudo-invariant features/control sets are identified.
 - **Adjustment scope:** How corrections are applied to the images.
 - **Overlap:** Whether the method requires overlapping pixels.
 - **Pixel units:** The radiometric units the method is able to operate on.
 - **Bands:** Whether bands relationships are preserved.
 - **Target reference:** What the target image is normalized to.
